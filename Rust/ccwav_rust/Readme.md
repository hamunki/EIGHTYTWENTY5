I am trying to convert the program `ccwav` by  
https://github.com/oyvholm/cwwav

from C to Rust. But I don't know C much, and I've only just started learning Rust. 

Manage your expectations accordingly.

Don't use this for anything, go get the original C program (https://github.com/oyvholm/cwwav) it's great.
