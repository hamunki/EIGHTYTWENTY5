This is taken from the program `cwwav` by https://github.com/oyvholm/cwwav

I am trying to make it stop putting an extra 1 second at the start of each audio file... or add a command line flag to turn that off in case it's something useful I don't understand.

But I don't know C much so it's not going very well.

Don't use this mess for anything, go get the original(https://github.com/oyvholm/cwwav) it's great.
